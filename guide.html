    <h1>Guide (spoiler alert)</h1>
    <p>I strongly recommend you to try the game out yourself first before you read this guide. It's a better experience! Only refer to this simple guide if you are stuck.</p><br><br>
    <p>Stellar is the main, and the first currency in this game. You can use Stellar to buy upgrades.</p>
    <p>You'll see a few buttons on the screen that contains a Cost, and a Damage number. These are called <b>automators.</b></p>
    <p>Automators increase your damage output, and you can buy them with Stellar. Each automator get stronger and stronger, but in turn costs exponentially more.</p>
    <p>You'll see an x, followed by a number on these buttons. They are multipliers. Every time you buy 10 of the same upgrade, the multiplier doubles, and gives you more damage!</p>
    <p>So what does damage do? You'll notice a HP Number. If your damage is larger than the HP, you will be able to 'hack' the enemy computer and get Stellar!</p>
