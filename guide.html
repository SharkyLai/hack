    <h1>Guide (spoiler alert)</h1>
    <p>I strongly recommend you to try the game out yourself first before you read this guide. It's a better experience! Only refer to this simple guide if you are stuck.</p><br><br>
    <p>Stellar is the main, and the first currency in this game. You can use Stellar to buy upgrades.</p>
    <p>You'll see a few buttons on the screen that contains a Cost, and a Damage number. These are called <b>automators.</b></p>
    <p>Automators increase your damage output, and you can buy them with Stellar. Each automator get stronger and stronger, but in turn costs exponentially more.</p>
    <p>You'll see an x, followed by a number on these buttons. They are multipliers. Every time you buy 10 of the same upgrade, the multiplier doubles, and gives you more damage!</p>
    <p>So what does damage do? You'll notice a HP Number. If your damage is larger than the HP, you will be able to 'hack' the enemy computer and get Stellar!</p>
    <p>Sometimes, you'll notice your Stellar not going up. That's because your Level is too high, and your damage is lower than the opponent's HP. Click the 'Last Level' button, and you should be fine.</p>
